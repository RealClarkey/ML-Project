## Stage 2:
- Implement backend data preprocessing (handle missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization, etc.)
- Display processed data summary and statistics to the user
- Provide multiple regression and classification models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Allow users to select ML models and configure basic hyperparameters
- Run training and display evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE)

## Stage 3:
- Add advanced hyperparameter tuning options (grid search, random search)
- Enable saving and loading of trained models for reuse
- Implement user authentication and dataset/model management in the database
- Add support for dataset versioning and history
- Provide visualization of model results (e.g., confusion matrix, feature importance)
- Integrate asynchronous processing for long-running training jobs  
- Prepare for deployment (Docker setup, cloud hosting readiness)
